# Getting Started

Goal: get one AI tool talking to the EasyEDA Pro project you already have open.

For the shortest version, use [Quick Start](./quick-start.md). This page explains the same first setup with a little more context.

If a step fails, jump to [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md).

## How It Fits Together

```text
AI tool -> local MCP server -> EasyEDA Pro extension -> open schematic or PCB
```

The AI tool launches the MCP server. The EasyEDA Pro extension connects to that server over a local WebSocket bridge. Both pieces run on your machine.

## What You Need

- Node.js `20` or newer
- `npm`
- EasyEDA Pro installed
- permission to load a local EasyEDA Pro extension
- one AI tool such as Claude Desktop, Codex CLI, Claude Code CLI, VS Code, or another MCP client

## 1. Build the Local Pieces

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run setup:local
```

This builds:

- `dist/index.js`, the MCP server
- `extension/dist/index.js`, the extension browser bundle
- `build/dist/easyeda_mcp_bridge.eext`, the packaged EasyEDA Pro extension

## 2. Connect One AI Tool

All clients launch the same command:

```bash
node /absolute/path/to/easyeda_mcp/dist/index.js
```

Choose one setup path:

| Tool | Use when | Setup guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Desktop | you want a desktop chat app | [Claude Desktop setup](./ai-client-setup.md#claude-desktop) |
| Codex CLI | you work from a terminal with Codex | [Codex CLI setup](./ai-client-setup.md#codex-cli) |
| Claude Code CLI | you work from a terminal with Claude | [Claude Code CLI setup](./ai-client-setup.md#claude-code-cli) |
| VS Code | you use Copilot Chat Agent mode | [VS Code setup](./ai-client-setup.md#vs-code) |
| Other MCP clients | your tool supports local MCP servers | [Generic MCP setup](./mcp-client-setup.md) |

Configure one tool first. Once `easyeda_doctor` works there, repeat the client setup for any other tool you want.

## 3. Load the EasyEDA Pro Extension

In EasyEDA Pro:

1. import the packaged extension from `build/dist`
2. enable external interaction permission
3. open a schematic or PCB project
4. use `MCP Bridge -> Reconnect` if it does not auto-connect

Use [EasyEDA Pro Extension Setup](./easyeda-extension.md) if you need the full extension flow.

## 4. Verify the Bridge

In your AI tool, run:

```text
Run easyeda_doctor and summarize whether the EasyEDA Pro bridge is healthy.
```

Healthy output should show:

- extension connected
- protocol compatible
- active document available

Then run:

```text
Run easyeda_get_context and tell me which EasyEDA Pro document is open.
```

With a schematic open, run:

```text
Run easyeda_schematic_snapshot and summarize the component and net counts.
```

If that works, your first setup is done.

## First-Run Checklist

- `dist/index.js` exists after `npm run setup:local`
- your AI tool launches `node .../dist/index.js`
- EasyEDA Pro is open
- a schematic or PCB is open
- the EasyEDA Pro extension is loaded
- external interaction permission is enabled
- `easyeda_doctor` reports a connected extension

## Daily Startup

After the first setup:

1. open your AI tool
2. open EasyEDA Pro
3. open the target project
4. let the extension connect
5. run `easyeda_doctor`

## Useful Commands

```bash
npm run setup:local
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

## Default Local Bridge

The MCP server uses `stdio` for the AI client and opens a local WebSocket bridge at:

```text
ws://127.0.0.1:8765
```

Optional overrides:

- `EASYEDA_MCP_WS_HOST`
- `EASYEDA_MCP_WS_PORT`
- `EASYEDA_MCP_WS_RETRY_MS` (defaults to `1000`)
